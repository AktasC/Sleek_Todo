# Sleek_Todo

A classy way to start coding with Rails
Everything here was written / tested on a Mojave Hackintosh.
The project's final form will probably reflect that with some Vibrancy ..


## Getting Started

```
cd Sleek_Todo
rake db:migrate
rails server
```
Head over to http://localhost:3000

### Prerequisites

* ruby^2.3.7
```
rvm install ruby 2.3.7
```
* rails
```
gem install rails
```
* bundler
```
gem install bundler
```

### Todo

* Better integration, thinking about Material Design ..
* Error Handling (blank entries, ...)
* Material icons instead of 'MARK AS COMPLETED' urghh
*
